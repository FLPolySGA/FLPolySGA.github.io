The Florida Polytechnic University Student Constitution, enacted in February 2015, is a dynamic document that establishes the Student Government Association, its mission, powers, and duties. With the signing of the Constitution, the SGA is formally operated by the students and for the students, a highly visible testament to democracy at the university level.
